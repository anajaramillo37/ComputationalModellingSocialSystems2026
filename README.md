# Computational Modelling of Social Systems
[Fariba Karimi](https://networkinequality.com/), 2026

Welcome to the tutorial materials for Computational Modelling of Social Systems. In this course, you will learn how to formulate and analyze computational models of social systems, in particular to study social interaction and the behavior of large groups of people and whole societies. The course integrates content about social dynamics and analytic tools to understand the complex behavior of social systems. After this course, you will acquire programming skills to implement, simulate, and visualize these models.

## Who are we?

Fariba Karimi is a Professor of Computational Behavioral and Social Sciences at the Graz University of Technology. Fariba Karimi leads the Complexity Science Hub’s computational social science team. Fariba received a PhD in physics and computational science from Umea University, in Sweden, in 2015 ,and was a PostDoc at GESIS – Leibniz Institute for Social Sciences, in Germany. Fariba’s research focuses on computational social science, the emergence of biases and inequality in networks and algorithms, and modelling human behavior. Her recent research revolves around the topics of visibility of minorities in social networks, the impact of network structure on ranking and recommender algorithms, and disparities in academia and its impact on under-represented groups. She combines statistical analyses of large datasets of online interactions with computational models, agent-based modeling, and network analysis. In 2022, Fariba, together with a team of international researchers, was awarded an EU Horizon grant to study multi-criteria fairness in AI systems. In 2023, she received the Young Scientist Award from the German Physical Society for her research on inequality in complex networks. In 2025, she received a European Research Council (ERC) Starting Grant to study Network Fairness in recommendation algorithms. From Winter 2023, Fariba has also been a full professor at TU Graz. She teaches this course in collaboration with students' tutor Thomas Zach and Fabian Krassnitzer, as well as the postdoctoral researcher Jaramillo Mejia, Ana Maria. Several people have contributed to the course materials over time, especially [Dr. Petar Jerčić](http://www.petarjercic.com/), [Dr. Jana Lasser](https://janalasser.at/) and [Dr. Max Pellert](https://mpellert.at/).

## Course Contents
The course is organized into 11 lectures, 6 tutorials, 2 assigments and 1 final project. This GitHub space will be used for the tutorial content, and all other information will be posted in the teaching center.


## Where to access materials

- Students at TU Graz can access the [course at Teach Center](https://tc.tugraz.at/main/course/view.php?id=4384) to get additional information, watch videos from previous years on Tube, and participate in the forums.
- Most of the communication will happen on [discord](https://discord.gg/9rYVEvzqNe), here you can ask questions, and we will respond in the shortest time period.
